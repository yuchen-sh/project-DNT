* **<font size=4> Project Overview </font>**

  * Next-generation (NextG) wireless networks provide users with customized, instant services, especially for bandwidth-hungry and latency-sensitive applications. Despite the significant advantages of NextG wireless networks (e.g., 5G/6G and millimeter-wave / Tera Hertz), realizing them faces several key deployment and evaluation challenges: 1) how to speed up the deployment of novel yet complex NextG network technologies; and 2) how to provide flexible testbed facilities with high availability. In this regard, there is an urgent need for a virtual solution that could create a digital model to replicate as accurately as possible the NextG network ecosystem and help tackle the above obstacles before the full realization of a real system. To this end, this project explores methodologies to run faithful digital network twins that replicate the physical NextG networks, and then to build and optimize the twins over the actual networks while considering communication, computing, and networking resource constraints. The built network twins provide an overarching architecture involving the whole life cycle of physical networks, serving the critical application of innovative technologies such as network planning, construction, optimization, and predictive evaluation, and improving the automation and intelligence level of the wireless networks. This transformative research provides a holistic framework for the implementation and optimization of digital network twins, thus catalyzing the deployment and operation of future network systems with major societal impact.
