<!-- * Activities: My researches are focused on two network scenarios for mmWave communication: 1) mmWave backhaul networks and 2) mmWave WLAN (primarily in the indoor context). For mmWave backhaul networks, which is proposed because of the existence of a large number of small-cell BSs within each macro-cell in 5G era and it aims to resolve the issue of forwarding the large amount of backhaul traffic between these small-cell BSs without wired connections, we have investigated design of high throughput relay-assisted backhaul network architecture in urban environments, analyzed the effects of obstacles on backhaul networks, and developed techniques for reconfiguration to provide survivability of backhaul networks in the presence of dynamic obstacles. For mmWave WLAN, we investigated access point (AP) mobility and the use of multiple APs to exploit location sensitivity. These activities primarily involved mathematical analyses and a combination of Matlab and ns-3 simulations. For the access point mobility work, a prototype of a ceiling-mounted AP mobility platform was developed and used for evaluation purposes to complement the mathematical analyses and simulation results. For the multi-AP work, several algorithms were proposed to generate optimal multi-AP placements such that the desirable performance and blockage-free operation can be achieved. The study of multiple mobile APs is also conducted. -->

<!-- * The works are focused on developing end-to-end simulator of mmWave out-of-band backhaul networks in ns-3. We first
introduce a design for an out-of-band backhaul module in ns-3. A custom backhaul network device is proposed that can be added to
nodes to enable out-of-band backhaul transmissions. We implement the anchored BS node connected to core-network with both access and backhaul abilities, the small-cell BS node with both access and backhaul abilities, and the mmWave relay node with only dedicated backhauling features. -->

<!-- * Another part of the works are focused on the developing end-to-end simulator for mmWave indoor scenarios in ns-3. We first
introduce a design for the obstacle module in ns-3, and design the matched channel model for simulating network performance in a variety of next-generation scenarios of interest. We also target on improving the simulation efficiency on ns-3 in the dense network scenarios with a number of obstacles, APs and users. -->

<!-- * Develop statistical and ray-tracing-based high-fidelity channel models in ns-3. Integrating 802.11ad & ay standards and protocols into the branch of ns-3. -->

<!-- ### &diams;	Developing Graphic Processing Units driver for video post-processing, in Intel R&D Ltd.
* Based on the Intel processor microarchitecture,  we developed the driver and doing the post-processing used in the video/film business for quality-improvement image processing, such as scaling, color correction, denoising, deinterlacing and high dynamic range rendering, etc. -->


<!-- * We developed the smart WiFi car based on Intel chips, which can be used for automatically taking pictures and sensoring environments. My works mainly responsible for designing overall framework and developing the underlying embedded drivers. We designed a set of inverse sequences with the interface multiplexing technology and applied to WIFI serial ports, so that the driver was freed from the shackles of hardware, saving on the cost of hardware development. We also designed the appication based on Android system, which was used to wirelessly remote control for the car. -->

<!-- * Because of the unbalanced computation ability of every node in space information networks, the efficiency and lightweight computation are two significant characteristics for network security protocols in this specific environment. We broke through the limits of old ways, abandoned the existing algorithms such as PKI or IBE, and devised several lightweight encryption schemes just based on hash and XOR operations. Through extensive theoretical analysis and simulation tests, it was evident that proposed optimized algorithms not only met all security requirements, but reduced the cost as well. -->

<!-- * Fulfilled information encryption of security components, designed distribution of keys and the storage security algorithm.
* Designed and filed two patents: 1) Linux Security Module (LSM) based database connection access control method, which applied the hook functions within the LSM framework; 2) virtual device based dynamic and static integrated security strategy update method, which was a solution of combining dynamic and static update strategies put forward to ensure the system's stability. -->

<!-- * Goals: This project is focused on the location-sensitivity aspect of mmWave communication, i.e. that small changes in the location of the transceiver of a mmWave link can have dramatic impact on performance. The major goals are to quantify location sensitivity and to investigate ways in which location sensitivity can be exploited, both at network design time and during network operation, to improve mmWave performance. Among the techniques investigated to take advantage of location sensitivity are controlled mobility and optimized use of relay nodes. -->
